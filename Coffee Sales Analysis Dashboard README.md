  - Converted the **Unit Price** into currency format with the `$` symbol to enhance readability.

  - Renamed tables for clarity and applied custom styles to improve visual structure.

- **📊 Pivot Tables & Visualizations:**  
  - Created a **Total Sales** sheet using Pivot Tables to summarize key metrics.  
  - Built dynamic charts powered by slicers and Pivot Table outputs to enable drill-down analysis.
